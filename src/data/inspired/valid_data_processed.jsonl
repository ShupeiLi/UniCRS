Or was that a different director?", "Motherless Brooklyn was directed by Edward Norton. Starring Bruce Willis", "Okay, I must have been thinking about an interview with Scorcese that mentioned Motherless Brooklyn. Did Motherless Brooklyn receive positive reviews?", "One critic said it requires a lot of patience to watch, but it has strong performances, and an interesting perspective. Most of the critics say it's an average movie.", "How has The Irishman been received critically?", "The ratings are pretty high, most people giving it around eight out of ten stars. One person called it an epic gangster drama. Sounds kind of typical for a Scorsese film", "Okay, I accept your recommendation, I would be interested in watching the trailer for The Irishman", "Great, I hope you enjoy it."], "resp": "Thanks for the recommendation!", "rec": [], "entity": [7776, 17027, 15882, 9931, 17227, 11947, 4874, 16627, 15860, 53, 16659, 12824, 9145, 7738, 12475, 13183]}

I don't know a lot of directors by name, but I think the stuff I've seen Taika Waititi work on has been pretty funny. His work on some of the Marvel movies is how I learned who he was, and then I saw Jojo Rabbit recently which was also funnier than I expected.", "I have not seen Jojo Rabbit yet. Maybe soon. So, Alien is out because that is horror. Are you up to date on Blade Runner?", "I am not. There's an old one and a new one for that movie isn't there? Also, I do like horror to a degree, but it needs to be a well-done movie. I like the Conjuring and Hereditary but I don't like Paranormal Activity, for example.", "Then I got to recommend Blade Runner. The original is a fine film where Harrison Ford does well. The new blade runner 2049 is very good. Modern special effects. Both movies are charterer studies.", "That sounds good! I like Harrison Ford and I'm sure the new one will be good then. I'm good with that recommendation.", "I recommend the original Blade Runner is about a hero cop that tracks down rouge robots..", "Okay! I think we're probably done here then :)", "The blade runner 2049 continues the story.", "That sounds really interesting. I always like when they add to a story instead of just remaking it.", "Some have complained that the original never made it clear if Decker, the main character was or was not a robot. So, you will get to decide that.", "Oh I like that. Is it kind of like how at the end of Inception you have to decide whether he was in reality or not?", "Humm, I missed Inception. You could say the same about Matrix in a way. The Blade Runner movies never deal with reality or not. Just human or not. ... What makes a human?", "Have you seen I, Robot? I feel like that movie tackles that question a bit, too", "Yes. I Robot does deal with this. Skynet is online and confused about identity issues.
